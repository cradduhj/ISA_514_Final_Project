## Project Overview
Producers/record labels make money when their signed artists and bands create popular songs, so our goal to help them get a better understanding of what makes a song “popular” or “viral” by building models to predict the success/popularity of a song on YouTube (measured as number of views) through the use of predictors like genre, artist history & type, song audio features, sentiment analysis of the lyrics and titles, and other text mining techniques.
